            <h2>What is brutalism?</h2>

            <p>Brutalism is a style of architecture that originated in the United Kingdom in the 1960's, marked by minimalist design, angular geometry and concrete building materials. This style of architecture
                was termed "brutal" because of it's lack of ornamentation and over-decorative design. It became a popular style in eastern european socialist countries due to it's pragmatic and affordable construction
                styles. However, it is in London that one can still see the most brutalist buildings.
                <br>
                <br>
                Below are several of my favourite brutalist constructions in London.

                <p><strong>The Barbican</strong> is a utopian brutalist complex consisting of housing, a cinema, a church, a school and many other amenities for residents. It was built by 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamberlin,_Powell_and_Bon" target="_blank">Chamberlin, Powell and Bon</a> in the late 1960's to attract 
                    young professionals to the inner city and has become an iconic representation of London's brutalist architecture. Unlike other brutalist housing estates the Barbican had higher rents and 
                    therefore more expense was put towards creating a premium living space. Today, it costs around half a million to buy an apartment on the estate.

            <h2 id="trellick">Trellick Tower</h2>

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trellick_Tower" target="_blank"><img src="Brutalist Architecture of London/TrellickTower.jpg" alt="Brutalist concrete residential tower block in front of clear blue sky" width="320" height="240"/></a>

                <p><strong>Trellick Tower</strong> in Kensall Green, Northwest London, was designed by architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ern%C5%91_Goldfinger" target="_blank">Ern≈ë Goldfinger</a> 
                    and built to fulfill social housing needs, but became a hub for vandalism, drug abuse and prostitution, earning it the name <em>The Tower of Terror</em>. It's seperate access tower gives it a unique
                     futuristic look that sets it apart from typical housing blocks. Today it has improved security features and has become a desireable location that houses 1600 residents with both private and social housing.

            <h2 id="southbank">Southbank Centre</h2>

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southbank_Centre"><img src="Brutalist Architecture of London/SouthbankCentre.jpg" alt="Concrete building with various angular appendages and walkways" width="320" height="240" /></a>

                <p><strong>The Southbank Centre</strong> is a complex of performing arts venues that includes the Hayward Gallery and the Royal Festival Hall. It was built incrementally over several decades and is representative 
                    of typical brutalist geometry with several concrete appendages coming together to create a geometrically unique structure. It hosts over 2000 performances of music, poetry and exhibition each year
                    and has become a cultural hub within the south of London.

            <h2 id="thamesmead">Thamesmead Estate</h2>

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thamesmead"><img src="Brutalist Architecture of London/Thamesmead.jpg" alt="Four concrete tower blocks behind a raised walkway" width="320" height="240"/></a>

                <p><strong>Thamesmead estate</strong> was built in the late 60's as a project intent on housing large numbers of people while minimizing the crime associated with social housing estates in London.
                    It's large pools and canals were inspired by Swedish housing complexes, which indicated that the calming influence of the water helped to reduce vandalism and crime. The elevated walkways
                    and angular design is typical of brutalist housing estates of this period.
