# brutalistarchitectureoflondon
A wiki on London's most famous Brutalist buildings

This was my first full project in the CodeAcademy full-stack track. It is entirely HTML. I used almost all of the HTML elements that I had learned on that first course. I decided to make the site about Brutalist buildings as I felt the stripped back, functional nature of Brutalist building was an appropriate fit for an HTML-only website.
